    "question": "What project are you most proud of and why?",
    "answer": "NoteNest is the project I'm most proud of. It’s my first full-stack app built in a monorepo, using React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and JWT. I deployed it with Vercel and Render after overcoming several challenges, including limitations with free hosting and backend integration."

    "question": "Have you faced any technical challenges, and how did you solve them?",
    "answer": "Yes. In NoteNest, connecting user notes through a relational database was tough at first. After hours of researching documentation and watching tutorials, I figured out the logic. I also fixed deployment issues on Render by debugging build configurations and adjusting scripts based on error messages."

    "question": "How do you process a new task or request when it’s assigned to you?",
    "answer": "I first ensure I fully understand the goal and scope. If anything’s unclear, I ask clarifying questions early. Then I break the task into smaller steps, prioritize them, and work through them methodically—providing updates when needed and testing thoroughly before delivering results."
